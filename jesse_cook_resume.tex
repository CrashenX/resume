\textit{\small{Research and Development}}\vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{0mm}%
\textsl{Research Scientist, Team Lead}\\
At EADS I worked as the team lead for the Linux systems development group. As
the systems development team lead I created a completely new design for SLAM-R
2.0 that allowed the product to have greatly enhanced stability and performance
while using modern programming practices to reduce the time to design and
implement new features.  I implemented the core design of the 2.0 version of
SLAM-R and lead a group of developers in implementing requirements within the
new core framework. I was able to perform both team lead and design tasks while
acting as a fully participatory member of the development team. In addition to
design and development as a team lead, I performed fundamental research in
areas related to network security, virtualization, high performance and high
scalability computing, cryptography, and cybersecurity both independently and on
a team. As a result of the research I produced several presentations and papers
including whitepapers for internal and external publication and a technical
proposal in response to a DARPA BAA.
\vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{0mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyzed software requirements
\item Created design and implementation plans
\item Developed timelines, release schedules, and component specifications
\item Implemented core components of the SLAM-R software
\item Developed taskings and time estimates
\item Assigned and tracked progress of team member tasks
\item Mentored team members
\item Reviewed code for correctness, efficiency, and standards compliance
\item Created coding and documentation standards
\item Interviewed prospective team members
\item Gathered software requirements
\item Worked independently to create and document Linux based operating system for the SLAM-R appliance.
\item Worked independently to create GUI and text based installers for the
      SLAM-R OS and software
\item Worked indepenently and on teams to perform fundamental research and
      create whitepapers in areas related to simulation, network security,
      virtualization, and high performance computing.
\item Worked with a team to create designs and draft proposals for DARPA BAAs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cymtec Systems}, Creve Coure, Missouri \hfill \textbf{2007 -- 2008}\vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
\textit{\small{Linux Systems Development}}\vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{0mm}%
At Cymtec I worked individually and on a team as the lead systems developer
working on the Sentry inline network security device and the Scout intrusion
detection system. I lead the design and development of version 2.0 of the
Sentry product, including designing and implementing several key features
including realtime TCP packet reassembly, realtime scanning of network traffic
for malware, URL filtering, LDAP integration with ACLs, a new software update
system, and support of two new hardware platforms. As part of the transition to
new hardware platforms I wrote new device drivers to support Intel hardware
network failover chips as well as modified existing Realtek NIC drivers and the
kernel networking stack for Linux 2.6.18. As the lead developer I was also able
to implement a number of performance optimizations that improved the real time
network scanning and malware detection speed from approximlately 100Mbps
sustained to over 800Mbps sustained while decreasing memory utilization from
150MB average to 75MB average when tested on the same hardware platform. I
worked with hardware providers to analyze technical specifications and develop
userspace drivers for a serial LCD interface and worked with third party
software vendors to integrate their licensed IP into the Sentry product.
\vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{0mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lead the systems development of both the Sentry and Scout products
\item Migrated the Sentry and Scout products to two new hardware platforms
\item Designed unified software update system for Sentry and Scout
\item Created a new event reporting application for Scout
\item Designed and implemented a new init system for the Linux based Scout OS
\item Developed a reporting system for deployed Scout units
\item Updated the Scout web user interface
\item Migrated existing utilities from Java to C++
\item Created a unified custom Linux based OS for the Sentry and Scout
      appliances
\item Created a Linux 2.6.18 kernel module to support Intel hardware failover
      chips.
\item Fixed bugs in the Linux mii network stack
\item Designed and implemented an embedded LCD configuration application for
      Sentry
\item Designed and implemented a highly efficient userspace TCP reassembly
      engine in C++.
\item Designed and mplemented real-time deep-packet inspection algorithms in C++
\item Designed and implemented an automated online software update system for
      appliances
\item Created a highly efficient XML parsing engine in C++
\item Created a pluggable alert system for IDS events
\item Designed and developed LDAP integrated ACLs for Sentry
\item Analyzed performance of existing Scout and Sentry code and optimized
      performance
\item Analyzed and reverse engineered network protocols
\item Created an internal documentation system
\item Managed source code repositories
\end{itemize}

\textsl{Systems Developer}\\
At Keane I worked as a junior developer and tier 3 helpdesk on contract to the
Missouri Department of Revenue on the state drivers license system. I worked
with customers to identify problems, remotely repair systems, and identify and
fix bugs in a large existing codebase. I was also responsible for creating and
pushing out software updates to hundreds of remote locations.

\textit{\small{Web Developer}}\vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{0mm}%
At RQ2 I worked as a contractor to implement the MobileTunes ecommerce site. I
worked with staff developers and management to establish requirements and
deliverables. I developed an ecommerce web application in PHP as well as
designed and implemented a MySQL database. In addition to development work I
created layouts and did graphical design work.

At The Brood I worked as an artist, writer and playtester for the {\tt Year of
the Zombie} table top game. I worked with the authors to develop and art
direction for the publications, presented ideas, and delivered print-quality
images for inclusion in layout and publication. In addition to art I
contributed several sections of non gameplay-related text, participated in
gameplay sessions, and worked with the writers and publishers to create an
advertising campaign for the {\tt Diaries of Becca} gameplay supplement.
