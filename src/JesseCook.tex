\section{Summary}

{\small By trade, one might call me software developer or engineering manager, but a better description
would be learner and achiever. Solving problems that make people's lives better is what drives me, and learning
new methods and tech along the way excites me. I am not afraid to work with customers, production systems,
or the entire software stack. As a developer, my focus has been on APIs, middleware, and the back end. As a
manager, I have spent most of my time supporting remote teams within the realm of cloud infrastructure.}

%__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
%\section{Objective}
%To drive positive change for my team and our users given a shared passion for tech and the domain
%To make a profound and positive difference in the lives of the people I work with and our customers
%To be a driving force within a team aimed at instigating positive change through technology worldwide
